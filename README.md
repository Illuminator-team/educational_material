# Illuminator examples

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of example applications of the [Illuminator](https://github.com/Illuminator-team/Illuminator).

To learn more about the Illuminator, please visit the [website](https://illuminator-team.github.io/Illuminator/). 

## Content

The examples are organized in different categories:
- üìÅ **configurations** - sample configuration and data input files for the Illuminator.
- üêç **scripts** - Python scripts demonstrating how to perform various tasks with the Illuminator.
- üìì **tutorials** - Jupyter Notebooks that showcase how to use the Illuminator interactively and visualize results.

## Running

The examples are available as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), input configurations (`.yaml`) and python scripts (`.py`). To start using the examples, download the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Download a copy of the repository
git clone https://github.com/Illuminator-team/educational_material.git
cd educational_material

# Install the dependencies within a conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate illuminator-examples
```
### Tutorials

To run the tutorials:

```bash
# Open the repository 
cd educational_material

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate illuminator-examples

# Launch JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

This will open JupyterLab in your browser, where you can run the notebooks interactively.

### Configurations

To run the Illuminator with one of the sample configurations: 

```bash
# Open the repository 
cd educational_material

# Open a configuration folder, for example:
cd configurations/tutorial4

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate illuminator-examples

# Run the Illuminator using a sample configuration 
illuminator scenario run Tutorial4.yaml
```

### Scripts

Instructions coming soon. (TODO)

### Tests

The `tests` directory is primarily intended for developers ‚Äî either those contributing new examples or developing new Illuminator features.

It includes tests that verify:
- Compatibility of the examples with the latest version of the [Illuminator PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/illuminator/).
- Correct behavior of examples (i.e. checking whether expected output files are generated and contain valid data).

To run the tests:
